I subsetted the News Articles from the start of 2009 to the end of 2014 and then built the frequency chart of messages. From the message figure below, We can find obvious peaks in some news, for example, News Online Today has a much larger number of messages than other news groups, followed by Homeland Illumination, Kronos Star, and The Abila Post. Reading the articles in these news files, especially in News Online Today, we can read that the city government and POK have a disagreement about the cause of death of Elian Karel, an employee from GASTech.

For the top 3 News groups of messages numbers, we can observe the most frequently appearing words from 3 tables below. For example, 'kronos' has appeared 212 times in News Online Today, 94 times in Homeland Illumination, and 55 times in Kronos Star. The word 'kronos' appears most frequently in the 3 groups, so the other terms related to this word should be paid attention to. At the same time, the words ‘government’, ‘pok’, and ‘police’ appear frequently. This provides the right direction for people to analyze the relationship between these institutions or organizations.
